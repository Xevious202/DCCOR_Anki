## Blueprint Verbs are important! (SRC: [Bloom's Taxonomy])
Indicate level of knowledge needed on each topic. Associate level is (on average) just above "Describe"
| Verb | Difficulty |
| ------ | ------ |
| Design | Expert level; No instances found on this Blueprint |
| Explain | Professional level; Understand show commands, identify and fix misconfigurations |
| Analyze | Intermediate Level; Make inferences and find evidence to support generalizations |
| Apply|Implement | Associate level; You may be asked how to configure this |
| Describe | Conceptual, likely not covered by simulated environment questions |
